# sWeights
Repository for a python implementation of sWeights

The sWeightsGeneral.py script can be used on any number of dimensions of data and with any number of different species present. Information on usage is in the top of the sWeightsGeneral.py script or in code.html.
Two examples are availible to demonstrate what is needed for the sWeightsGeneral.py script to run.

Example1D.py is an example of two species fitable in one dimension used to seperate two species in another dimension.

Example2D.py is an example of two species fitable in two dimensions used to seperate two species in another dimension.

The GenerateData.py script is needed for the examples to run.
